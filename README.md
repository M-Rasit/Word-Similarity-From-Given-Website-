Hi :wave:,

In this repository I created a streamlit app that takes input the url and word and brings most related words in the give url. I used Request and BeautifulSoup library to get text from given url and SpaCy library for word similarity.

The result is:

![Streamlit](https://github.com/M-Rasit/Word-Similarity-From-Given-Website-/blob/master/images/streamlit.png?raw=true)

Thank you:tulip:
